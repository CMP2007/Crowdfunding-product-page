## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This practice helped me to review everything I had learned or reinforced in the junior-level practices I did at Frontend Mentor.

### Continued development

My next step is to take some courses, although I am not very clear if they will be theoretical courses on programming concepts or language courses in which I can get a certificate.
